## 📅 Week 1 – Computer Networks & Internet Fundamentals

## 📌 Overview

Week 1 was focused on building **strong foundations in computer networking**  understanding how the internet actually works under the hood.

Rather than jumping directly into frameworks, this week covers:
- How clients and servers communicate
- How browsers resolve domains and fetch data
- How data moves reliably (and sometimes unreliably) across networks

These concepts are critical for backend development, debugging production issues, performance optimization, and system design.
