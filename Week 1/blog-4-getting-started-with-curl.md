# Getting Started with cURL

Before frameworks and APIs, everything on the web comes down to **HTTP requests and responses**.

This blog introduces `cURL` as a simple but powerful tool to send HTTP requests directly from the terminal and understand what’s actually happening between a client and a server.

It walks through making your first request, breaking down HTTP requests and responses, and clearly showing the difference between a browser request and a cURL request.

If you want to truly understand how APIs work — beyond clicking buttons in the browser — this blog is a great starting point.
