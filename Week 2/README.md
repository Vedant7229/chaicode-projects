## 📅 Week 2 – HTML & CSS Basics

## 📌 Overview

Week 2 was focused on understanding the **core building blocks of the web** — HTML for structure and an introduction to CSS for styling.

The goal this week was not to design fancy pages, but to clearly understand:
- How HTML markup is written and interpreted by the browser
- How Emmet helps write HTML faster and more efficiently
- How CSS works at a basic level, especially selectors and cascading rules

## 🎯 Why This Week Matters

HTML and CSS are the foundation of everything on the web.  
Understanding them properly early helps avoid confusion later when working with layouts, frameworks, and JavaScript.

This week sets the base for deeper CSS, layouts, and interactive web development in the upcoming weeks.
