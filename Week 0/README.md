# Week 0 – Git & GitHub Basics

Week 0 is meant to **set the foundation** before we start actual development.

These blogs focus on **why Git exists**, **what problem it solves**, and **how Git and GitHub work at a basic level**.  
The goal is not to memorize commands, but to understand the **core idea of version control** so things don’t feel confusing later.

## What this week targets

- Understanding why version control is needed (the real problem, not theory)
- Knowing the difference between Git and GitHub
- Getting familiar with common terms and basic commands
